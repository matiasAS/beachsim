Open the solution, Install sql.
Compile. 
The Program was made in Visual Basic 2010.


Beachsim.exe is a precompiled runable of our program. 
Run the application, Beachsim.exe, in the same directory as the dll.
Beachsim.exe does not need the mysql connector to be installed. 
Only compiling the source code in visual basic requires that. 

An offline button is provided in the login screen just in case the 
online database we use goes down. 

Otherwise, there is an account already created for the program. 
Username: Onianig@hotmail.com Password: beachsim
