To enable this module, follow these instruction:

Note: Before updating your website to release 6.x-1.7 first UNINSTALL (disable and then uninstall) any previous release of itweak_login. Otherwise Internationalization will not register properly.

1. Upload it to your sies/all/modules folder and enable it on the admin/build/modules page.
2. Go to admin/user/permissions and enable "can change own password" permission for all roles that are allowed to change their own password (good rule of thumb is to enable for all roles to have same permissions as before this module installation)
